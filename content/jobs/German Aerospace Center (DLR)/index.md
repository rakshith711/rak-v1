- Thesis on the topic - "Response Time Analysis of Tasking Framework Task Chains"
- Response Time analysis of Real Time systems modelled as a set of parallel DAG tasks executing on a global multi-core processor, where each task are periodic/sporadic and executed based on fixed priority scheduling using a newly created execution model. Implemented in python for a system in the satellite.
- An improvement to the previous research, where only periodic tasks and executed in FCFS algorithm were considered.
